Initial public hosting, more for backup than for public useage. 

Beyond very basic infrastructure not much has been done. I plan to start writing 
3rd edition of book, and then continue writing app and book in paralel, so that 
the two are in sync.

As for book, I'm leaving ODT and LibreOffice behind, and starting anew with LaTeX. 
Another new is usage of SVG for graphics. This will also require Python script for 
generating SVGs and maybe another one for converting SVGs into format recognized by 
LaTeX, most likely PNG.
