\label{ch:Appendix}

Appendix contains description of algebraic notation, extended from the base described here: \\
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic\_notation\_(chess)}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic\_notation\_(chess)}. \\
This description mostly covers short notation, and is written in monospace font, e.g. \alg{Nc3}.

Parts of classic notation clashes with new developments, and so had to be covered with
exceptions made specificaly for Classical Chess, so that algebraic notation retains
compatibility with its classic form. These exceptions are written in monospace italics,
e.g. \algcty{Nxb3}.

For instance, \algcty{0-0}, \algcty{O-O} and their Queen's side siblings for castling had
to go in extended algebraic notation, since there are multiple castling choices available.
Another example, \algcty{x} as annotation for a capturing move, e.g. \algcty{Nxv3}, since
this might also be interpreted as disambiguation.

For official reference FIDE handbook is used, current date of publication is 2018-01-01: \\
\href{https://handbook.fide.com/chapter/E012018}{https://handbook.fide.com/chapter/E012018}.

Here, \algfmt{CAN} is used to indicate compatibility with Classical Chess notation, even if
examples are written on chessboards for other variants. \algfmt{CAN} almost always means
short notation, and only occasionally long, if appropriate.

Point in FIDE handbook refers to a code under which definition can be found on above website,
e.g. \algfmt{FIDE~C.9.3}.

\section*{Notation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Notation}
\label{sec:Appendix/Notation}

Simple movement is denoted the same way as in \algfmt{CAN}, piece (always written as upper case) +
destination field, which consists of rank (always written in lower case) + file (a number).

In this example of \hyperref[fig:scn_ct_03_define_step_ply]{Pegasus moving to destination field 3},
movement of the piece would be written as \alg{Gf8}. The same movement in \algfmt{XAN}, would be
written as \alg{Gc2-f8}.

When moving Pawn, symbol is omitted, so only destination field is written. In this example of
\hyperref[fig:04_croatian_ties_en_passant]{Pawn rushing to field 2}, movement can be written as
\alg{h5}. Long notation would be \alg{h2-h5}.

\subsection*{Disambiguation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Disambiguation}
\label{sec:Appendix/Notation/Disambiguation}

Disambiguation is position notation, shortened to minimum neccessary to distinguish from another
position(s). It contains one of: just file, just rank, rank + file, in that order of preferance.
This is the same as in \algfmt{CAN}, described in: \\
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic\_notation\_(chess)\#Disambiguating\_moves}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic\_notation\_(chess)\\
\#Disambiguating\_moves}, see also \algfmt{FIDE C.10}.
Only difference is that disambiguation really affects plies (movement of a single piece),
and not move as a whole, as multiple pieces might get moved in a single, cascading move.

For instance, should \hyperref[fig:scn_ct_03_define_step_ply]{Pegasus simple move example}
had another light Pegasus at \alg{i2} field, move to destination field 3 would be written
as \alg{Gcf8}.

\subsection*{Capturing}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Capturing}
\label{sec:Appendix/Notation/Capturing}

Capturing move is denoted with \alg{*} (asterisk) at the end, usually followed by the captured
piece. Only for Classical Chess capturing is denoted with \algcty{x}, before destination field.
Here, \hyperref[fig:scn_ct_04_pegasus_movement]{Pegasus could capture opponent's Pawn}, which
would be written as \alg{Gg4*P}, or just \alg{Gg4*}, if captured piece is not needed.

In \algfmt{CAN}, the same move would be written as \algcty{Gxg4}. Note, FIDE handbook requires
captures made by Pawn to contain starting file, \algcty{x}, and then destination field; see
\algfmt{FIDE~C.9.3}.
If \hyperref[fig:scn_mv_22_wave_activation_by_capture_pawn]{Wave activated by Pawn example} had
dark Wave instead of light one, light Pawn would be able to capture it, which in \algfmt{CAN}
would be written as \algcty{fxe8}. The same move in new notation is written as \alg{e8*}, and
if captured piece is also written \alg{e8*W}.

\subsection*{En passant}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{En passant}
\label{sec:Appendix/Notation/En passant}

En passant is denoted with \alg{:} (colon), after destination field. In this
\hyperref[fig:04_croatian_ties_en_passant]{en passant example} dark Pawn on the right might capture
light Pawn if rushed, which is written as \alg{h3:}. Rank of captured Pawn can be written after
\alg{:}, so our example might now be \alg{h3:5}, if captured Pawn has been rushed to field 2.

If disambiguation is needed, it is written as previously described. Usually, it's enough to add
starting file before destination field. If previous example had additional dark Pawn located at
\alg{g4}, en passant would be written as \alg{ih3:}, or \alg{ih3:5}.

In \algfmt{CAN}, both en passant and its disambiguation form are written as \algcty{ixh3 e.p}, where
\algcty{e.p.} stands for en passant; see \algfmt{FIDE~C.9.3}.

\subsection*{Castling}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Castling}
\label{sec:Appendix/Notation/Castlingn}

Castling is noted with \alg{\&} (ampersand), after King's symbol and destination file. This
\hyperref[fig:age_of_aquarius_castling_left_04]{castling example} would be written as \alg{Kd\&},
and this \hyperref[fig:one_castling_right_04]{castling example} as \alg{Kr\&}. Rank at which
castling Rook ended can be written after \alg{\&}, the same examples would now be written as
\alg{Kd\&e} and \alg{Kr\&q}.

Only for Classical Chess \algcty{0-0} and \algcty{O-O} for King's side, \algcty{0-0-0} and
\algcty{O-O-O} for Queen's side are accepted as castling notation.

\subsection*{Pawn promotion}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Pawn promotion}
\label{sec:Appendix/Notation/Pawn promotion}

Pawn promotion is also written the same way as in \algfmt{CAN}, as described in detail: \\
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic\_notation\_(chess)\#Pawn\_promotion}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic\_notation\_(chess)\\
\#Pawn\_promotion}, with Pawn's destination field + piece to which it was promoted to,
like so: \alg{e8Q}. Inserting \alg{=} (equal sign) between field and promoted-to piece
is also supported, e.g. \alg{e8=Q}.

If \hyperref[fig:scn_aoa_05_delayed_promo_pawn_2_moved]{promotion is being delayed}, usage of
\alg{=} is mandatory, as there is no immediate piece to promote to, e.g. \alg{l14=}.
If \hyperref[fig:scn_aoa_04_delayed_promo_pawn_2_tagged]{Pawn tagged for promotion} moves
before actual promotion, it losses its tag, which is denoted with \alg{==} (double equal
sign), like so: \alg{e12==}.

\subsection*{Ply}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Ply}
\label{sec:Appendix/Notation/Ply}

\hyperref[sec:Terms/Ply]{Ply} is a movement of a single piece in a cascading move. Two plies
are separated by \~{} (tilde). In the example starting with
\hyperref[fig:scn_ma_11_cascading_init]{Queen activating a Pyramid}, which then activates another
Pyramid; example is comprised of series of 4 images, each corresponding to one ply, while last
image depicts ending state. This can be written as \alg{Qf7\~{}Ai7\~{}Ai9}.

In \algfmt{XAN}, the same would be written as \\
\alg{Qk2-f7\~{}Af7-i7\~{}Ai7-i9}. A pair of \alg{[}, \alg{]} (square brackets) can be used to
gather each ply, like so: \\
\alg{[Qk2-f7]\~{}[Af7-i7]\~{}[Ai7-i9]}.

\subsection*{Conversion}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Conversion}
\label{sec:Appendix/Notation/Conversion}

Conversion is noted with \alg{\%} (percentage) after destination field. Example starting with
\hyperref[fig:scn_ma_08_conversion_init]{Bishop activating Pyramid}, which then converts opponent's
Rook is covered by 3 images, 2 corresponding to 2 plies, and last one is for ending state. This
is written as \alg{Bd5\~{}Ah5\%}. Optionally, converted piece can be written after \alg{\%} symbol,
so it would be \alg{Bd5\~{}Ah5\%R}.

In \algfmt{XAN}, it would be \alg{Bh9-d5\~{}Ad5-h5\%}. With both plies gathered and converted piece
noted it would be \alg{[Bh9-d5]\~{}[Ad5-h5\%R]}.

Starchild is immune to conversion, Pyramid attempting such a thing is
\hyperref[sec:Terms/Oblation]{oblationed}. Failed conversion is noted with \alg{\%\%} (double percentage)
after destination field. This example of
\hyperref[fig:scn_o_13_starchild_conversion_immunity_init]{conversion immunity} would be written as
\alg{Bl23\~{}Ah23\%\%}. In \algfmt{XAN}, with ply gathering, it would be
\alg{[Bs16-l23]\~{}[Al23-h23\%\%]}.

\subsection*{Complex movement}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Complex movement}
\label{sec:Appendix/Notation/Complex movement}

Individual steps are separated by \alg{.} (single dot), multiple steps are separated by \alg{..} (two dots).
In this example, \hyperref[fig:scn_hd_03_centaur_multi_step]{Centaur has to choose 2 different steps},
which it will then follow for the rest of ply. Lets say that destination field is 8, writing it as
just \alg{Cp15} is not good enough since at least 2 different paths lead to the same destination field.

The best way to write it is with both initial steps, i.e. \alg{C.c5.g6..p15}, because this is exactly definition
of such a movement, and will contain no ambiguity. Sometimes, it might be enough if only first step is written,
i.e. \alg{C.c5..p15}. The one of other paths leading to the same \alg{Cp15} would be \alg{C.f2.g6..p15}. Note
also \alg{.} separating piece and the first step, without it first step would be taken as an initial field.

Not recomended, but still possible is to write \emph{some} step along the way, e.g. \alg{C..i11..p15}.
Care must be taken to write step which really differentiate paths, otherwise noted path might inadvertently
also denote another. For instance, in addition to original path, \alg{C..j9..p15} might also denote
\alg{C.b4.f5..p15}, which happens to cross \alg{j9} as well.

\subsection*{Trance-journey}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Trance-journey}
\label{sec:Appendix/Notation/Trance-journey}

Trance-journey is noted with \alg{@} (at sign), instead of normal ply separator \alg{\~{}} (tilde),
before \hyperref[fig:scn_o_16_trance_journey_init_starchild]{entranced piece} takes off. This
\hyperref[fig:scn_cot_18_light_light_shaman_interaction_start]{trance-journey example}, if without any
interactions with pieces on entranced Shaman's step-fields, would be written as \alg{Hd11\~{}We13@Hg24}.
In \algfmt{XAN}, it would be \alg{[Hf10-d11]\~{}[Wd11-e13]@[He13-g24]}.

Displacements are noted by writing \alg{<} (less-than) immediately after step in which a piece is reached,
followed by field of displacement. Optionally, displaced piece can be writen before displacement-field. The
same \hyperref[fig:scn_cot_19_light_light_shaman_interaction_end]{trance-journey example}, now with all
interactions taken into account, would be written as \\
\alg{Hd11\~{}We13@H..e18<i14..m12<j17..g24}. In \algfmt{XAN}, with gathered plies and displaced pieces
it would be \\
\alg{[Hf10-d11]\~{}[Wd11-e13]@}\\
\alg{[He13..e18<Ni14..m12<Pj17..g24]}.
% \alg{[Hf10-d11]\~{}[Wd11-e13]@[He13..e18<Ni14..m12<Pj17..g24]}.

Captures are noted by writing \alg{*} (asterisk) immediately after step in which a piece is reached,
optionally followed by a captured piece. This
\hyperref[fig:scn_cot_21_dark_light_shaman_interaction_end]{trance-journey example with captures} would be
written as \\
\alg{Hf12\~{}Wd9\~{}We13@H..e18*..m12*..g24}. In \algfmt{XAN}, with gathered plies and captured pieces it
would be \\
\alg{[Hi10-f12]\~{}[Wf12-d9]\~{}[Wd9-e13]@}\\
\alg{[He13..e18*N..m12*P..g24]}.
% \alg{[Hi10-f12]\~{}[Wf12-d9]\~{}[Wd9-e13]@[He13..e18*N..m12*P..g24]}.

Failed trance-journey is noted with \alg{@@} (double at-sign) after entrancing ply. Optionally, oblationed
piece can be written after \alg{@@}. In this
\hyperref[fig:scn_o_22_trance_journey_failed]{failed trance-journey example} all step-fields are blocked by
Kings, Stars, Monoliths, so entranced dark Bishop is oblationed, which is written as \alg{Iy2\~{}Iz1@@},
and in \algfmt{XAN}, with plies gathering and oblationed piece, as \alg{[Iz3-y2]\~{}[Iy2-z1]@@B}.

\subsection*{Syzygy, demoting to Pawn}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Syzygy, demoting to Pawn}
\label{sec:Appendix/Notation/Syzygy, demoting to Pawn}

Demoting to Pawn is noted by writing \alg{>} (greater-than), followed by disambiguating position, i.e.
one of rank, file or rank + file, in that order. Optionally, disambiguation can be preceded by piece which
was demoted, and demotion-field can be written instead of just a disambiguation.

In this \hyperref[fig:scn_d_15_syzygy_2_stars_init]{syzygy example}, if Monolith was moved by light player,
then either light Wave or light Bishop could be demoted to Pawn. If Bishop was chosen, that would be written
as \alg{Mm12>p}. In \algfmt{XAN}, with piece and demotion-field noted it would be \alg{Mn14-m12>Bp8}. There
is no plies gathering, since only Monolith moved, so there is only one ply.

\subsection*{Syzygy, ressurection}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Syzygy, ressurection}
\label{sec:Appendix/Notation/Syzygy, ressurection}

Ressurection is written by appending \alg{\$} (dollar sign) after the move, followed by piece which was
ressurected. If Wave or Starchild has been ressurected on an empty field, position is appended after piece.
If there was no suitable empty field at which Wave or Starchild could be ressurected, ressurection is not
performed, which could be written by appending \alg{\$\$} (double dollar) after the ply. Since there are
no actual side-effects to failed ressurection, \alg{\$\$} is optional.

In case \hyperref[fig:scn_o_24_syzygy_starchild_init]{ressurection example} ended by
\hyperref[fig:scn_o_25_syzygy_starchild_end]{ressurecting Queen}, this would be written as \alg{It9\$Q},
and in \algfmt{XAN} it would be \alg{Ii23-t9\$Q}.

If previous example ended by \hyperref[fig:scn_o_26_syzygy_starchild_ressurection]{ressurecting Starchild},
it would be written as \alg{It9\$Iu8}. In \algfmt{XAN}, it would be \alg{Ii23-t9\$Iu8}.

If all fields suitable for ressurection are occupied, it is written as \alg{It9\$\$}, in \algfmt{XAN} it
would be \alg{Ii23-t9\$\$}. Writing it as \alg{It9}, or \alg{Ii23-t9} is fine, it just doesn't note failed
intention.

\subsection*{Teleportation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Teleportation}
\label{sec:Appendix/Notation/Teleportation}

Teleportation is noted by separating plies with \alg{|} (vertical bar) instead of usual \alg{\~{}} (tilde),
followed by field at which piece teleported. If Wave teleported, vertical bar is followed by Wave and its
destination field, optionally followed by activated pieces' plies, if there were any.

If piece teleported, but there is no empty portal-field, teleportation failed, and is noted with \alg{||}
(double vertical bar). The same notation is used for teleported Wave, if all step-fields are blocked, or
not present on a chessboard at all.

This \hyperref[fig:scn_n_02_teleport_init]{teleportation example} would be written as \alg{Ba18|q18}, in
\algfmt{XAN} it would be \alg{Bd15-a18|q18}.

This \hyperref[fig:scn_n_03_teleport_move_2]{blocked teleportation example} would be written as \alg{Ra18||},
or in \algfmt{XAN} it would be \alg{Ra13-a18||}.

In this \hyperref[fig:scn_n_04_teleport_move_3]{Wave teleporting example}, followed by
\hyperref[fig:scn_n_05_teleport_end]{Wave teleported example}, if activated Pyramid would move 2 fields upward,
complete move would be written as \alg{Gg15\~{}Wa18|Wl4\~{}Al6}. In \algfmt{XAN}, with plies gathering, it would
be \\
\alg{[Gi11-g15]\~{}[Wg15-a18]|[Wr1-l4]\~{}[Al4-l6]}.

If previous example ended with \hyperref[fig:scn_n_06_teleport_wave_blocked]{teleported Wave blocked} example,
it would be written as \alg{Gg15\~{}Wa18||}, and in \algfmt{XAN} it would be \alg{[Gi11-g15]\~{}[Wg15-a18]||}.

This \hyperref[fig:scn_d_13_teleporting_wave_cascade]{cascading teleportation example} would be written by
sequencing teleportations like so \alg{Gh2\~{}Wb4|Wa24|Wr4\~{}Bt6}, if activated Bishop would take upper-right
diagonal. In \algfmt{XAN}, with plies gathering, it would be \\
\alg{[Gj6-h2]\~{}[Wh2-b4]|[Wm18-a24]|[Wx1-r4]\~{}}\\
\alg{[Br4-t6]}.

\subsection*{Pawn-sacrifice}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Pawn-sacrifice}
\label{sec:Appendix/Notation/Pawn-sacrifice}

Pawn-sacrifice is written by separating plies with \alg{::} (double colon) instead of usual \alg{\~{}} (tilde),
followed by capturing steps. All Pawn-capturing steps made by Serpent must be written, captured pieces are not
needed, as they can only be opponent's Pawns.

This \hyperref[fig:scn_tr_21_pawn_sacrifice_init]{Pawn-sacrifice} followed by
\hyperref[fig:scn_tr_22_pawn_sacrifice_end]{capturing opponent's Pawns} is written as \\
\alg{Sm15\~{}Am11::S..m17*..m19*.l20*.m21*.n20*.o21*}. In \algfmt{XAN}, with plies gathering, it would be \\
\alg{[Sr14-m15]\~{}[Am15-m11]::}\\
\alg{[Sm15..m17*..m19*.l20*.m21*.n20*.o21*]}.

If there aren't enough Pawns captured to isolate only one path an additional, non-capturing steps needs to be
written as well. In previous example, if Serpent stopped at \alg{m17}, at least 2 differrent paths are possible.
Previous example started with \alg{Sm15\~{}Am11::S.l16.m17*} path, the other path is \alg{Sm15\~{}Am11::S.n16.m17*}.
Again, for longer paths care must be taken to write step(s) which really differentiate paths, otherwise written
path might inadvertently also denote others.

Care must also be taken to properly use step separator \alg{.} (dot), and multiple step separator \alg{..} (two
dots). Step separator \alg{.} is for separating 2 steps, where one step immediately follows the other. Multi-step
separator \alg{..} is for separating 2 steps which have at least one step in-between. For instance, first, short
path in previous paragraph (i.e. \alg{Sm15\~{}Am11::S.l16.m17*}) might also be confused with
\alg{Sm15\~{}Am11::S..l16..m17*}, which is a shorthand for \alg{Sm15\~{}Am11::S.l14.k15.l16.k17.l18.m17*}, a very
different path.

\subsection*{Off-board traversal}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Off-board traversal}
\label{sec:Appendix/Notation/Off-board traversal}

Steps onto virtual, off-board fields are not written. For trance-journey, each possible destination field designates
unique path on its own, so additional fields are neccessary only if there is some kind of interactions between
entranced Shaman and pieces on its step-fields.

For a Wave activated by Serpent, noting destination field might be enough, if destination field is on a different file
and a different rank than starting field. If destination field is on the same rank or on the same file as starting field,
then first step needs to be noted as well. In this
\hyperref[fig:scn_tr_15_serpent_activated_wave_ply]{Wave activated by Serpent} example, if destination field is \alg{j4},
then there is only one path leading to it, and it's \alg{Se5\~{}We5.f4.g5.h4.i5.j4}, so it can be noted just as
\alg{Se5\~{}Wj4}.

If destination field is \alg{i5}, which is on the same rank as Wave's ply starting field, then \alg{Se5\~{}Wi5} might be
interpreted as either \alg{Se5\~{}We5.f4.g5.h4.i5}, or as \alg{Se5\~{}We5.f6.g5.h6.i5}, so first step is needed, like so
\alg{Se5\~{}W.f4..i5}.

If Wave activated by Serpent is blocked from reaching destination field using only on-board step-fields, then only one
path exists, and only destination field is needed. For instance, if in this
\hyperref[fig:scn_tr_16_wave_out_of_board]{Wave off-board example} dark Knight were located at \alg{u9}, and destination
field is \alg{v10} it would block Wave's ply \alg{Sv6\~{}W.u7.v8.u9.v10}, and only path avaiable to Wave would be
off-board, i.e. \alg{Sv6\~{}W..v8..v10}.

For a Wave activated by Unicorn or Centaur, noting destination field might be enough, if destination field does not share
file, rank or diagonal with starting field. For instance, if destination in this
\hyperref[fig:scn_mv_26_wave_off_board]{Wave off-board example} is field 2, then it can be noted just as \alg{Uo3\~{}Wp12}.
If, in the same example, destination is field 1, then original path is \alg{Uo3\~{}W.m4.p6.n7..o10}, the other available
path is \alg{Uo3\~{}W..n6.p7.m9.o10}, so at least one other step is needed to distinguish between the two paths.

\subsection*{Move symbols, annotations}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Move symbols, annotations}
\label{sec:Appendix/Notation/Move symbols, annotations}

Draw offer is noted with \alg{(=)} (equal sign in brackets), see \algfmt{FIDE C.12}.
Checks are noted with \alg{+} (plus sign), checkmates are noted with \alg{\#} (hashtag), these are optional, see \algfmt{FIDE C.13}.
Placeholder for a move is \alg{...} (ellipsis), usually used to resume game score after commentary, see\\
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic\_notation\_(chess)\#Notation\_for\_a\_series\_of\_moves}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic\_notation\_(chess)\\
\#Notation\_for\_a\_series\_of\_moves}.

Annotations are written at the end of a complete move, e.g. \alg{ef8*!}. It is recommended to use \alg{\_} (underscore)
to separate \algfmt{AN} and annotations, like so \alg{ef8*\_!}. Usage of \alg{\_} is mandatory when annotation can be
confused for a regular chess \algfmt{AN}.

For instance, \alg{e8=} might be Pawn tagged for promotion, or both players have equal chances of winning, see\\
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic\_notation\_(chess)#Annotation\_symbols}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic\_notation\_(chess)\\
\#Annotation\_symbols}. In such a case, regular chess \algfmt{AN} is assumed, i.e. it is Pawn tagged for promotion.
If annotation is meant instead, it has to be written as \alg{e8*\_=}.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Grammar}
\label{tbl:Appendix/Grammar}
\end{table}

Summary tries to describe notational grammar in more formal, concise way.
Annotations are not covered, as they are short-hand commentary, usually added
later when game is presented to readers.

Verbatim values (e.g. \alg{x}) are as they appear in \algfmt{AN}, compatibility
values (e.g. \algcty{x}) are used exclusively for \algfmt{CAN}. Empty value
\algfmt{?} is mostly used to denote Pawn, when its piece symbol is dropped from
notation.

Option separator \algfmt{|} is used to present choice between 2 values, e.g.
\algfmt{?} \algfmt{|} \alg{P}. Options can be chained, as in
\algfmt{?} \algfmt{|} \alg{+} \algfmt{|} \alg{\#}. If there are too many
sequential values to list, range option \algfmt{..} is used instead, e.g.
\alg{a} \algfmt{..} \alg{z}.

Grouping options contain items to be repeated, \algfmt{[ ]} for items to appear
or not, \algfmt{( )} to repeat items 0 or more times, and \algfmt{\{ \}} to repeat
items at least once.

Formatting and spacing is added to improve legibility, normally \algfmt{AN} is
written without any gaps. When space is needed, it is written as \alg{\_}
(underscore). Options are also valid regardless of formatting, spacing, e.g.
\begin{alltt}
<abc> = \alg{def}
    \alg{ghi}
  | \alg{jkl}
\end{alltt}
means \algfmt{<abc>} is to be replaced with either \alg{defghi} or \alg{jkl}.

Groups can contain other groups, if they do, they are valid until first matching
closing brace. Each closing brace always closes exactly one group. For instance,
\begin{alltt}
<abc> = \alg{a}[\alg{b}[\alg{c}]\alg{d}]\alg{e}
\end{alltt}
gives \alg{abcde}, \alg{abde}, \alg{ae} for \algfmt{<abc>}.
Braces cannot overlap, i.e. if group contains other group, it must contain it in
its entirety. For instance:
\begin{alltt}
<abc> = \alg{a}[\alg{b}(\alg{c}]\alg{d})\alg{e}
\end{alltt}
is not valid example, because first group \algfmt{[ ]} is closed containing
dangling (open, but not closed) second group \algfmt{( )}.

Grammar is written without context, to determine which pieces, files and ranks
are available for a particular variant see
\hyperref[tbl:Appendix/Introduction/Variants]{Variants},
\hyperref[tbl:Appendix/Introduction/Chessboards]{Chessboards} and
\hyperref[tbl:Appendix/Introduction/Pieces]{Pieces} tables.
