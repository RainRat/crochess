\noindent
Age of Aquarius is chess variant which is played on 14 x 14 board,
with light yellow and light green fields and light tan-gold and
dark green pieces. In algebraic notation, columns are enumerated
from 'a' to 'n', and rows are enumerated from '1' to '14'. A new
piece is introduced, Unicorn.

\end{wrapfigure}
Unicorn is a piece similar to Knight, only it can jump longer on
opposite color fields. Just as Knight, Unicorn is not obstructed
by any piece in its' surroundings.

In algebraic notation, symbol for Unicorn is 'U'.

\end{wrapfigure}
On fields with the same color as Unicorn, it can move exactly the
same way Knight does.

\label{fig:scn_aoa_02_unicorn_opposite_color}
% \centering
\end{figure}

On fields in opposite color, Unicorn can jump much longer. Again, just as
Knight, Unicorn is not hampered by surrounding pieces. Own pieces on marked
step-fields would prevent Unicorn to move. The same marked fields are also
capture-fields, opponent's pieces on them could be captured.

For comparison, Knight's step-fields are also numbered (gray).

% Promotion ***********************************************************

\section*{Promotion}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Promotion}
\label{sec:Age of Aquarius/Promotion}

In all variants prior to this one promotion was forced, Pawn had to be
promoted immediately upon reaching opposite end of chessboard (or when
\hyperref[sec:Mayan Ascendancy/Pyramid/Promotion]{reached by own Pyramid} on
\hyperref[sec:Definitions/Sides of a chessboard]{opponent's side of the board}).
Promotion otherwise is identical to one in Classical Chess, which is
described in details here: \\
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion\_(chess)}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion\_(chess)}.

In this variant promotion is not forced, Pawn does not have to be promoted
immediately, or at all. Pawn can be promoted later in a game, if it hasn't
moved between being tagged for promotion and actual promotion itself. Thus,
promotion can take place only on a field at which Pawn has been tagged for
promotion.

If tagged Pawn moves before actual promotion, that opportunity has been
lost. Field at which Pawn has been tagged for promotion does not hold tag,
and does not grant ability to promote to any other Pawn passing over it.

Delayed promotion is a complete move, it can contain only promotion of one
Pawn and nothing else.

% \centering
\end{figure}

Here, light player is about to tag Pawn 2 for promotion, using Pyramid
activated by Bishop. Note, Pawn 3 is not yet eligible for promotion, as it's
still on own side of chessboard.

To speed things up, next images show dark player's response (grey arrow),
and light player's plan for next move (green arrow). Each depicted position
is after dark player's move, but before light player's move.

Here, dark Unicorn is attacking tagged Pawn 2. Pawn 2 is to move next.

\caption{Pawn 1 about to get promotion}
\label{fig:scn_aoa_05_delayed_promo_pawn_2_moved}
% \centering
\end{figure}

Dark Unicorn closed in, attacking both Pawn 2 and Bishop. Since Pawn 2 moved
away from field P at which it was tagged for promotion, that opportunity has
been lost, and can't be recovered. Label P on a field just marks where Pawn 2
was tagged for promotion. Field P isn't special in any way, it won't make e.g.
Pawn 3 tagged for promotion when reached.

Light Pawn 1 is about to go next.

Light Pawn 1 is now tagged for promotion, and is to be promoted later.
Dark Unicorn closed in again, capturing light Bishop.

Light Pawn 2 is about to go next.

\caption{En passant}
\label{fig:08_age_of_aquarius_en_passant}
\end{wrapfigure}
Rush and en passant are identical to those in Classic Chess, only difference
is that Pawn can now move longer on initial turn, up to 5 fields in this
variant.

Converted opponent's Pawns cannot be rushed, even if converted on an initial positions
of own Pawns.

\section*{Castling}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Castling}

Castling is the same as in Classical Chess, only difference is that King can move 2, 3, 4 or 5 fields across.
All other constraints from Classical Chess still applies.

\noindent
\begin{figure}[!h]
% \begin{figure}[!t]

% \centering
\end{figure}

In example above, all valid King's castling moves are numbered.

\caption{Castling long left}
\label{fig:age_of_aquarius_castling_left_04}
% \centering
\end{figure}

In this example King was castling long to the left. Initial King's position is marked with "K".
After castling is finished, left Rook ends up on the field immediately right to the King.

Converted opponent's Rooks cannot be castled, even if converted on an initial positions
of own Rooks.

\section*{Initial setup}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Initial setup}

Compared to initial setup of Mayan Ascendancy, Unicorn is inserted between Pyramid and Knight
symmetrically, on both sides of chessboard. This can be seen in the image below:
