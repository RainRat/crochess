\section*{Odd variants}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Odd variants}
\label{sec:Definitions/Odd variants}

Odd variants are those which board size is odd number. Odd variants
have the same newly introduced piece, and the same rules as their
even, normal cousins. Odd variants lack both Queens, 2 Pawns, and
board is smaller for 1 row and 1 column, compared to related even,
normal variant.

Note that in Odd Classical Chess, since it's played on a 7 x 7 board,
there is no en-passant move. This is so because on a very small board
there is no room for a Pawn to perform 2-field initial move without
stepping outside of own side of a board and thus preventing opponent
to rush its' Pawn at the same column.

Here is shown how to convert Mayan Ascendancy into odd variant,
the same principle is used for all the other variants.

Starting with Mayan Ascendancy variant, first we mark Queen's column
(red arrow), and an empty row (grey) for deletion.

After removing marked row, column and pieces on them (both Queens and
2 Pawns), reminding pieces are then clamped together. Colors of fields
are swapped as neccessary to alter properly from the light field in
lower right corner.

\end{figure}

After assembling chessboard back together, Queen's side figures are swapped in
pairs, e.g. here Bishop $\leftrightarrow$ Knight, Pyramid $\leftrightarrow$ Pegasus.
Swapping of figures starts from King's position, and goes on until Rook is reached.
Both light and dark figures are swapped.

\section*{Rush}

\label{sec:Definitions/Rush}

Rush is always allowed for Pawns which haven't moved, to the maximum
extent of own side of chessboard. This also applies to Pawns converted
in last/first row.

Royal powers ...

    Refers to unique attributes of the king: being subject to check and checkmate, the inability to be captured, and the ability to castle.
    Protection from effects/actions induced/performed by passive and teleporting pieces, i.e. Pyramid, Wave, Star, Monolith.
    Protection from forced move, check, checkmate during trance-journey.

\section*{Passive powers}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Passive powers}
\label{sec:Definitions/Passive powers}

King, Star and Monolith cannot be converted, nor activated.
Starchild cannot be converted, but can be activated.

Light Starchild does accumulate momentum, but does not spend it while moving.
Dark Starchild does not accumulate momentum, but does spend it while moving.

\section*{Promotions}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Promotions}
\label{sec:Definitions/Promotions}

Pawn can be promoted to any piece except Pawn, King, Star or Monolith.
Pawn can only be promoted to a piece of the same color.

Promotions are forced, i.e. Pawn has to be promoted immediately, in the following
variants: Classical Chess, Croatian Ties, Mayan Ascendancy and Conquest of Tlalocan.
Forced promotion means that Pawn has to be promoted in the same move in which it
reached opposite end of chessboard. If it was promoted by Pyramid, it has to be
promoted in the very same ply in which it was reached by that Pyramid.

Promotions are not forced in all the other variants. Additionaly, Pawn can be promoted
at some point later in game. Promotion in that case is whole move, i.e. move in which
only promotion is made. During that time (between been tagged for promotion and actual
promotion itself), Pawn must not move, i.e. it has to be actually promoted in the same
field it was tagged for promotion. If tagged Pawn moves before it gets promoted, it
looses its' tag, i.e. can no longer be promoted.

Pawn can be promoted to Queen if and only if existing Queen has been captured, in
Nineteen and One variants. In these variants only one Queen, in the same color, is
ever allowed to be present on chessboard. In all the other variants, each side can
have multiple Queens present on chessboard at the same time.

% \section*{Movement limits}
% \addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Movement limits}
% \label{sec:Definitions/Movement limits}

% Maximum number of steps either Serpent or Monolith can make is determined by the size
% of a chessboard.

% \begin{equation}
% sml = \lfloor \frac{n}{3} \rfloor
% \end{equation}

% \begin{equation}
% mml = \lfloor \frac{n}{11} \rfloor
% \end{equation}

% where:

% $n$ is a size of a chessboard for a given variant

% $\lfloor\ \rfloor$ is a floor function, giving smallest integer larger than its' argument

% $sml$ - Serpent's movement limit, i.e. maximum number of steps Serpent can make

% $mml$ - Monolith's movement limit, i.e. maximum number of steps Monolith can make
