Miranda's veil is chess variant which is played on 16 x 16 board, with
white and dark violet fields and light magenta and indigo pieces. In
algebraic notation, columns are enumerated from 'a' to 'p', and rows
are enumerated from '1' to '16'. A new piece is introduced, Wave.

Wave is passive piece, it has to be activated before it can move.
Activation is done in the same way as with Pyramid. Own piece
has to capture field at which Wave is located before Wave can
move.

After activation Wave moves like piece that just activated it.
Additionally, Wave can move over multiple step-fields, in the same
fashion, even if activating piece can move for only one. Pawn can
activate Wave not just at its' capture-fields but also on its'
step-fields. Wave is not blocked by any piece, it can continue its'
movement freely as if there are no pieces on board at all.

Wave cannot capture any piece. Consequenly, Wave cannot check opponent's
King, and hence can't participate in a checkmate.

Wave can activate any own piece, except King. Wave can also activate
opponent's Wave.

In algebraic notation symbol for Wave is 'W'.

As before, activation of Wave is done by full move to left by Pegasus,
shown in red. Note that Pegasus, just as any other piece, cannot move
past Wave, except another Wave, own or opponent's, shown in grey.

Unlike any
other piece, Wave does not spend received momentum moving, it can
move past momentum limit, in this case for more than just 5 fields.
Momentum carried by Wave is in entirety transferred to piece
activated by said Wave (or lost if no piece is activated).

\end{figure}

Pawns can activate Waves on own capture-field giving it 1 momentum (1).
Pawns can also activate Waves on step-fields, giving it count of traveled-over
step-fields as momentum. For Pawn 2 that would be 1 momentum, while for Pawn 3
that would be 3.
