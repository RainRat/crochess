    Do something.

This is the text of the section.

.. todo::

    Do nothing.

``libcrochess`` is designed to be as portable as possible, so it uses only standard
C library. As such, there is no networking support. It is possible to redirect
``stdin``, ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` into and from crochess application so that other
application, library takes over networking.
