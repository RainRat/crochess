.. _lbl-libcc-ccposdefs:

Position defines
================

Documents ``cc_pos_defs.h`` and ``cc_pos_defs.c`` files, which contain various
piece steps definitions and functions.

.. _lbl-libcc-ccposdefs-piecestepsdata:

Piece steps data
----------------

.. c:macro:: CC_STEPS_LEN_INVALID_DATA_TERMINATED

    Value to ignore array size constraint on various functions,
    and use invalid step as a guard to indicate end of an array.

.. _lbl-libcc-ccposdefs-piecesteplengths:

Piece step lengths
------------------

    Length of an array is count of useful elements in it, without
    terminating data.

    This is similar how :c:`strlen()` does not count zero-terminating
    :c:`char` (:c:`'\0'`) in strings.

.. c:macro:: CC_STEPS_PAWN_LEN

    Equals to :c:`3`.

.. c:macro:: CC_STEPS_SIDEWAYS_PAWN_LEN

    Equals to :c:`5`.
