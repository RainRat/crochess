.. _lbl-libcc-ccparsedmove-functions:

Functions
---------

.. c:function:: CcMove * cc_move__new( char const * notation, size_t max_len__d, CcParsedPly ** plies__d_n, CcMoveStatusEnum status )

    Returns newly allocated move.

    Takes ownership of :c:`plies__d_n`, inner pointer will be set to :c:data:`NULL`,
    if valid move is produced.

    If no valid move is produced, :c:`plies__d_n` is still valid,
    and accessible.

    :param notation: Original notation, as received from a user.
    :param max_len__d: *Optional*, maximum length of :c:`notation` to copy, can be :c:macro:`CC_MAX_LEN_ZERO_TERMINATED`.
    :param plies__n: **Ownership transfer**, *optional*; plies linked list, inner pointer can be :c:data:`NULL`.
    :param status: Move status.
    :returns: A newly allocated move if successful, :c:data:`NULL` otherwise.

.. c:function:: CcMove * cc_move_append( CcMove ** moves__iod_a, char const * notation, size_t max_len__d, CcParsedPly ** plies__d_n, CcMoveStatusEnum status )

    Appends a newly allocated move to a given queue.

    Takes ownership of :c:`plies__d_n`, inner pointer will be set to :c:data:`NULL`,
    if valid move is produced.

    If no valid move is produced, :c:`plies__d_n` is still valid,
    and accessible.

    :param moves__iod_a: **Ownership**, *optional* *input/output* parameter; queue of moves,
                         to which a new move is appended, inner pointer can be :c:data:`NULL`.
    :param notation: Original notation, as received from a user.
    :param max_len__d: *Optional*, maximum length of :c:`notation` to copy, can be :c:macro:`CC_MAX_LEN_ZERO_TERMINATED`.
    :param plies__n: **Ownership transfer**, *optional*; plies linked list, inner pointer can be :c:data:`NULL`.
    :param status: Move status.
    :returns: Weak pointer to a newly allocated move if successful, :c:data:`NULL` otherwise.

.. c:function:: CcMove * cc_move_duplicate_all__new( CcMove * moves )

    Duplicates a given :c:`moves` queue, and all accompanying resources,
    into a newly allocated queue.

    :param moves: A queue to duplicate.
    :returns: A newly allocated duplicate of :c:`moves` if successful, :c:data:`NULL` otherwise.

.. c:function:: bool cc_move_free_all( CcMove ** moves__f )

    Frees all moves in a queue, and all associated entities.

    :param moves__f: A queue to :c:func:`free()`.
    :returns: A newly allocated duplicate of :c:`moves` if successful, :c:data:`NULL` otherwise.

.. c:function:: size_t cc_move_plies_count( CcMove * move )

    Function returns count of plies owned by a given move.

    :param move: A move.
    :returns: Count of plies if successful, ``0`` otherwise.

.. _lbl-libcc-ccparsedmove-notations:

Notations
---------

Game score consists of numbered list of :term:`cycle`\s, each :term:`cycle` in one
line with its own index, light player move followed by dark player move, like so:

    .. code-block:: text
        :force:

        1. <light player move #1> <dark player move #1>
        2. <light player move #2> <dark player move #2>
        3. <light player move #3> ...

Notations list is a simple dump of all notations from parsed moves, alternating
between light player and dark player moves, where each move is placed verbatim on
its own line, like so:

    .. code-block:: text
        :force:

        <light player move #1>
        <dark player move #1>
        <light player move #2>
        <dark player move #2>
        <light player move #3>

.. c:function:: size_t cc_move_all_notations_size( CcMove * move, bool is_score )

    Function returns size of all notation strings taken together, with optional
    formatting, if game score flag was given.

    :param move: A move.
    :param is_score: Flag, whether notation should be formatted as game score (if
        :c:data:`true`), or as a simple move list (if :c:data:`false`).
    :returns: Formatted string size if successful, ``0`` otherwise.

.. c:function:: char * cc_move_as_string__new( CcMove * move, bool is_score )

    Function returns a newly allocated string, containing notations from all
    parsed moves in a given linked list, with optional formatting.

    :param move: A move.
    :param is_score: Flag, whether notation should be formatted as game score (if
        :c:data:`true`), or as a simple move list (if :c:data:`false`).
    :returns: Valid pointer to newly allocated string if successful, :c:data:`NULL`
        otherwise.
