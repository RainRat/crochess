    :c:`struct` is tagged with the same :c:struct:`CcGame` name.

.. _lbl-libcc-ccgame-functions:

Game functions
--------------

.. c:function:: CcGame * cc_game__new( CcGameStatusEnum status, CcVariantEnum ve, bool do_setup )

    Function returns next game status, based on current player
    resignation.

    Linked list of performed moves will be empty. If necessary,
    it can be populated once newly allocated game is returned.

    :param status: Initial game status.
    :param ve: Variant to play.
    :param do_setup: Flag, if start from initial setup (:c:data:`true`),
                     or from manually set-up position (:c:data:`false`).
    :returns: A newly allocated game if successful, :c:data:`NULL` otherwise.

.. c:function:: CcGame * cc_game_duplicate_all__new( CcGame * game )

    Duplicates a given game into a newly allocated one.

    :param game: Game to duplicate.
    :returns: A newly allocated game if successful, :c:data:`NULL` otherwise.

.. c:function:: bool cc_game_free_all( CcGame ** game__f )

    :c:func:`free()`\s game, and all owned resources (chessboard, moves).

    :param game__f: A game to free.
    :returns: :c:data:`true` if successful, :c:data:`false` otherwise.

.. c:function:: CcGame * cc_game_setup_from_string__new( char const * setup, CcGame * before_setup__d )

    Functions returns a newly allocated :c:struct:`CcGame`, from a given
    string, and optionally initial :c:struct:`CcGame`, containing starting
    positions, game status, and moves.

    Setup string contains list of ``<piece><file><rank>[<tag>]`` items, ``<tag>`` is optional.

    ``<piece>`` is usual piece symbol, as used in AN; dark/dim pieces are represented by lower-case letter, e.g. dark Bishop would be ``b``, instead of usual ``B``.

    If a particular field has to be cleared, ``' '`` (space) is used for ``<piece>``.

    ``<file>`` is any letter from ``a`` to ``z``, inclusive.

    ``<rank>`` is any number from ``1`` to ``26``, inclusive.

    ``<tag>`` is optional, if given it can be one of ``P``, ``R``, ``E``, ``C``; representing delayed promotion, rushing, en passant and castling tags.

    If optional, initial game setup is not given, setup string has to be preceded by variant abbreviation, i.e. use one of:

        * cc  --> Classical Chess
        * ct  --> Croatian Ties
        * ma  --> Mayan Ascendancy
        * aoa --> Age Of Aquarius
        * mv  --> Miranda's Veil
        * n   --> Nineteen
        * hd  --> Hemera's Dawn
        * tr  --> Tamoanchan Revisited
        * cot --> Conquest Of Tlalocan
        * d   --> Discovery
        * o   --> One

    Use lower-cased variant abbreviation to set dark player on the move; otherwise, it's light player's move.

    Variant abbreviation has to be followed by ``' '`` (space).

    Some examples: ``"O Ra1C,Pa2R,Pb23P,bc24,Pc7,pd8,Pf11E"``, ``"o Bh5,Bd9,Wk2,Ro2"``. ``"bd1, a11,Bl1,bd9"``; the last one can only be used along with an existing game setup.

    :param setup: A setup string.
    :param before_setup__d: An *optional*, initial game. If given, it is
                            copied before any modification specified by a
                            given string is applied.
    :returns: A newly allocated game if successful, :c:data:`NULL` otherwise.
