Linked path segments
--------------------

.. c:struct:: CcPathLink

    Linked path :term:`segment` is essentially a linked list of traversed positions,
    with possible alternative paths after divergence.

    Each path :term:`segment` is comprised of path links linked only by
    :c:member:`next` member, the same as in ordinary linked list.

    Divergent :term:`path`\s are introduced by single :c:member:`diverge` path;
    all other possible :term:`path`\s after the same divergence are then linked
    by :c:member:`alt`.

    .. warning::

        All :c:member:`diverge`, :c:member:`alt`, and :c:member:`next` members
        must always be a singular pointer to any path link.

        Circular references within a path tree, or shared among them, are not
        allowed, and will likely cause crash.

    .. c:member:: CcPosDesc pos

        A position.

    .. c:member:: cc_uint_t momentum

        Momentum a moving piece had when this position was reached.

    .. c:member:: struct CcPathLink * diverge

        Link to divergent paths.

        Every divergent path has this step as its starting position.

        One divergent path links to another via :c:member:`alt` member.

    .. c:member:: struct CcPathLink * alt

        Link to alternative to this path segment.

        This link should be set only after divergence, or if part of alternative
        paths, i.e. if this step has been pointed-to by either :c:member:`diverge`,
        or :c:member:`alt`.

    .. c:member:: struct CcPathLink * next

        Link to next position descriptor in a straight path segment.

    :c:`Struct` is tagged with the same :c:struct:`CcPathLink` name.

.. c:function:: CcPathLink * cc_path_link__new( CcPos pos, cc_uint_t momentum )

    Function allocates a new path link.

    :param pos: A position.
    :param momentum: A momentum.
    :returns: Pointer to a newly allocated path link if successful,
        :c:data:`NULL` otherwise.

.. c:function:: CcPathLink * cc_path_link_append( CcPathLink ** pl__iod_a, CcPos pos, cc_uint_t momentum )

    Function appends a newly allocated path link to a given path segment,
    as its :c:member:`next` member.

    If path segment :c:`*pl__iod_a` is :c:data:`NULL`, it will be initialized
    with a newly allocated path link as its only element.

    :param pl__iod_a: **Ownership**, *optional* *input/output*; path segment.
    :param pos: A position.
    :param momentum: A momentum.
    :returns: A weak pointer to a newly allocated linked position
              if successful, :c:data:`NULL` otherwise.

.. c:function:: CcPathLink * cc_path_link_extend( CcPathLink ** pl__iod_a, CcPathLink ** pl__n )

    Extends existing path segment with another one, as its :c:member:`next`
    segment.

    If path segment to extend (:c:`pl__iod_a`) hasn't been allocated yet,
    this will initialize it with content of an extending path segment, i.e.
    :c:`pl__n`.

    .. note::

        Extending path segment :c:`pl__n` has its ownership transferred to
        extended path segment :c:`pl__iod_a`; as a result, inner pointer
        :c:`*pl__n` is :c:data:`NULL`\ed.

    :param pl__iod_a: **Ownership**, *optional* *input/output*; a path segment
        to extend.
    :param pl__n: **Ownership transfer**; path segment with which to extend
        existing segment.
    :returns: Weak pointer to extended portion of a resulting path segment if
        successful, :c:data:`NULL` otherwise.

.. c:function:: CcPathLink * cc_path_link_fork( CcPathLink ** pl_step__a, CcPathLink ** pl_alt__n )

    Function extends divergent paths of a given path step (:c:`pl_step__a`) with
    path segment (:c:`pl_alt__n`) as an additional alternative path.

    If a given path step doesn't have divergent path yet, function initializes it
    with a given alternative path.

    .. note::

        Extending path segment :c:`pl_alt__n` has its ownership transferred to
        diverging path segment :c:`pl_step__a`; as a result, inner pointer
        :c:`*pl_alt__n` is :c:data:`NULL`\ed.

    :param pl_step__a: **Ownership**; a path step from which to diverge.
    :param pl_alt__n: **Ownership transfer**; diverging path.
    :returns: Weak pointer to alternative path if successful,
        :c:data:`NULL` otherwise.

.. c:function:: CcPathLink * cc_path_link_duplicate_all__new( CcPathLink * path_link )

    Duplicates complete linked tree of a given path segment into a newly
    allocated one.

    :param path_link: A path segment.
    :returns: A pointer to newly allocated path segment if successful,
              :c:data:`NULL` otherwise.

.. c:function:: bool cc_path_link_free_all( CcPathLink ** pl__f )

    Frees all path links from complete linked tree of a given path segment.

    :param pl__f: A path segment to :c:func:`free()`.
    :returns: :c:data:`true` if successful, :c:data:`false` otherwise.

.. c:function:: size_t cc_path_link_len( CcPathLink * path_link, bool count_all )

    Function returns length of a given path segment; optionally also includes
    :c:member:`diverge`, :c:member:`alt` branches.

    :param path_link: A path segment.
    :param count_all: Flag, whether to include :c:member:`diverge`, :c:member:`alt`
        path segments (if :c:data:`true`), or only a given path segment
        without branching (if :c:data:`false`).
    :returns: Length of a given path segment if successful, ``0`` otherwise.

.. c:function:: size_t cc_path_link_count_all_seqments( CcPathLink * path_link )

    Function returns count of all segments, including :c:member:`diverge`,
    :c:member:`alt` ones.

    :param path_link: A path segment.
    :returns: Count of all segments if successful, ``0`` otherwise.

.. c:function:: char * cc_path_link_to_string__new( CcPathLink * path_link )

    Function returns string containing user-readable representation of a complete
    path tree, including :c:member:`diverge`, :c:member:`alt` branches.

    :param path_link: A path segment.
    :returns: A newly allocated, null-terminated (``'\0'``) string if
        successful, :c:data:`NULL` otherwise.
    :seealso: :c:func:`cc_pos_to_string()`
