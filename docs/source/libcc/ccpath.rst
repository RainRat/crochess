Path
====

Documents ``cc_path.h`` and ``cc_path.c`` files, which contain various
path definitions, types and functions.

    Paths are discussed in greater details in :doc:`paths`.

Linked path segments
--------------------

.. c:struct:: CcPathLink

    Node containing path segment, and links to other nodes in a path tree.

    Forking :term:`path`\s are introduced by single :c:member:`fork` path; all
    other possible :term:`path`\s after the same e.g. divergence are then linked
    by :c:member:`alt`.

    .. warning::

        All :c:member:`fork`, :c:member:`alt`, and :c:member:`next` members are
        owners of the remainder of a path tree they are pointing to; and must
        always be a singular pointer within a path tree to their respective
        forking, alternating, or subsequent path.

        Any back-references within a path tree, or shared among them, are not
        allowed, and will likely cause crash.

    .. seealso::

        :ref:`lbl-libcc-paths-segmenttree`

    .. c:member:: CcStep * steps

        Steps, a path segment.

        Linked path :term:`segment` is a linked list of all steps taken from one
        position to another in order in which they were made; only the last step
        in a :term:`segment` can also have side-effect (i.e. interaction with
        encountered piece).

    .. c:member:: struct CcPathLink * fork

        Link to forking paths.

        Forking paths are used after divergence; and also to facilitate multiple,
        independent paths from a starting position.

        Every forking path has this step as its starting position.

        One forking path links to another via :c:member:`alt` member.

        .. seealso::

            :ref:`lbl-libcc-paths-segmenttree-forking`

    .. c:member:: struct CcPathLink * alt

        Link to alternative to this path segment.

        Alternative paths are used when there are multiple possible interactions with
        encountered piece.

        This link should be set only after divergence, or if part of alternative
        paths, i.e. if this step has been pointed-to by either :c:member:`fork`,
        or :c:member:`alt`.

        .. seealso::

            :ref:`lbl-libcc-paths-segmenttree-alternative`

    .. c:member:: struct CcPathLink * next

        Link to subsequent path.

        Subsequent paths are used when interaction does not produce multiple alternative
        paths (e.g. when Serpent displaces Pawns), or when path segment is continuation of
        movement in previous segment (e.g. a piece encounters transparent piece).

        .. seealso::

            :ref:`lbl-libcc-paths-segmenttree-subsequent`

    :c:`Struct` is tagged with the same :c:struct:`CcPathLink` name.

.. c:function:: CcPathLink * cc_path_link__new( CcStep * steps )

    Function allocates a new path link.

    :param steps: Steps, a path segment.
    :returns: Pointer to a newly allocated path link if successful,
        :c:data:`NULL` otherwise.

.. c:function:: CcPathLink * cc_path_link_append( CcPathLink ** pl__iod_a, CcStep * steps )

    Function appends a newly allocated path link to a given path segment,
    as its :c:member:`next` member.

    If path segment :c:`*pl__iod_a` is :c:data:`NULL`, it will be initialized
    with a newly allocated path link as its only element.

    :param pl__iod_a: **Ownership**, *optional* *input/output*; path segment.
    :param steps: Steps, a path segment.
    :returns: A weak pointer to a newly allocated linked position
              if successful, :c:data:`NULL` otherwise.

.. c:function:: CcPathLink * cc_path_link_extend( CcPathLink ** pl__iod_a, CcPathLink ** pl__n )

    Extends existing path segment with another one, as its :c:member:`next`
    segment.

    If path segment to extend (:c:`pl__iod_a`) hasn't been allocated yet,
    this will initialize it with content of an extending path segment, i.e.
    :c:`pl__n`.

    .. note::

        Extending path segment :c:`pl__n` has its ownership transferred to
        extended path segment :c:`pl__iod_a`; as a result, inner pointer
        :c:`*pl__n` is :c:data:`NULL`\ed.

    :param pl__iod_a: **Ownership**, *optional* *input/output*; a path segment
        to extend.
    :param pl__n: **Ownership transfer**; path segment with which to extend
        existing segment.
    :returns: Weak pointer to extended portion of a resulting path segment if
        successful, :c:data:`NULL` otherwise.

.. c:function:: CcPathLink * cc_path_link_fork( CcPathLink ** pl_step__a, CcPathLink ** pl_alt__n )

    Function extends forking paths of a given path step (:c:`pl_step__a`) with
    path segment (:c:`pl_alt__n`) as an additional alternative path.

    If a given path step doesn't have forking path yet, function initializes it
    with a given alternative path.

    .. note::

        Extending path segment :c:`pl_alt__n` has its ownership transferred to
        diverging path segment :c:`pl_step__a`; as a result, inner pointer
        :c:`*pl_alt__n` is :c:data:`NULL`\ed.

    :param pl_step__a: **Ownership**; a path step from which to fork.
    :param pl_alt__n: **Ownership transfer**; diverging path.
    :returns: Weak pointer to alternative path if successful,
        :c:data:`NULL` otherwise.

.. c:function:: CcPathLink * cc_path_link_duplicate_all__new( CcPathLink * path_link )

    Duplicates complete linked tree of a given path segment into a newly
    allocated one.

    :param path_link: A path segment.
    :returns: A pointer to newly allocated path segment if successful,
              :c:data:`NULL` otherwise.

.. c:function:: bool cc_path_link_free_all( CcPathLink ** pl__f )

    Frees all path links from complete linked tree of a given path segment.

    :param pl__f: A path segment to :c:func:`free()`.
    :returns: :c:data:`true` if successful, :c:data:`false` otherwise.

.. c:function:: size_t cc_path_link_len( CcPathLink * path_link, bool count_all )

    Function returns length of a given path segment; optionally also includes
    :c:member:`fork`, :c:member:`alt` branches.

    :param path_link: A path segment.
    :param count_all: Flag, whether to include :c:member:`fork`, :c:member:`alt`
        path segments (if :c:data:`true`), or only a given path segment
        without branching (if :c:data:`false`).
    :returns: Length of a given path segment if successful, ``0`` otherwise.

.. c:function:: size_t cc_path_link_count_all_seqments( CcPathLink * path_link )

    Function returns count of all segments, including :c:member:`fork`,
    :c:member:`alt` ones.

    :param path_link: A path segment.
    :returns: Count of all segments if successful, ``0`` otherwise.

.. c:function:: char * cc_path_link_to_string__new( CcPathLink * path_link )

    Function returns string containing user-readable representation of a complete
    path tree, including :c:member:`fork`, :c:member:`alt` branches.

    :param path_link: A path segment.
    :returns: A newly allocated, null-terminated (``'\0'``) string if
        successful, :c:data:`NULL` otherwise.
