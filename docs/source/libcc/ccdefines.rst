Defines
=======

Documents ``cc_defines.h`` file, which contains constants and macros used throughout project.

.. _lbl-libcc-ccdefines-shorthandtypes:

Shorthand types
---------------

Types for the convenience of typing less.

.. code-block:: C
    :force:

    typedef unsigned char uchar;
    typedef unsigned short ushort;
    typedef unsigned int uint;

Constant representing minimum value for all :c:`unsigned` types.

.. code-block:: C
    :force:

    #define CC_UNSIGNED_MIN (0)

.. _lbl-libcc-ccdefines-maybebool:

Maybe bool
----------

Maybe bool represents :c:`bool` values, which may undefined or uninitialized, or
has to differentiate error state from valid :c:`true` and :c:`false` response.

It is defined as :c:`enum CcMaybeBoolEnum;`, with values:

.. code-block:: C
    :force:

    typedef enum CcMaybeBoolEnum {
        CC_MBE_Void = -1, /* Void (undefined, uninitialized, or error) value. */
        CC_MBE_False = 0, /* Boolean false value. */
        CC_MBE_True = 1, /* Boolean true value. */
    } CcMaybeBoolEnum;

Macros to convert from and into :c:`bool` value.

.. code-block:: C
    :force:

    #define CC_BOOL_TO_MAYBE(bool_val) /* Converts bool value into CcMaybeBoolEnum. */
    #define CC_MAYBE_IS_TRUE(maybe_bool) /* Checks if CcMaybeBoolEnum value is CC_MBE_True. */
    #define CC_MAYBE_IS_FALSE(maybe_bool) /* Checks if CcMaybeBoolEnum value is CC_MBE_False. */
    #define CC_MAYBE_IS_VOID(maybe_bool) /* Checks if CcMaybeBoolEnum value is CC_MBE_Void. */

.. _lbl-libcc-ccdefines-xor:

XOR
---

Macro to evaluate logical XOR, i.e. to check if one or the other :c:`bool` value
is :c:`true`, but not both.

.. code-block:: C
    :force:

    #define CC_XOR(bool_1,bool_2) /* Both bool_1, bool_2 are converted to Boolean values. Returns either 1 (true) or 0 (false). */

.. note::

    In case of integer(s), one has to be non-zero, while the other has to be zero,
    for :c:`XOR` to return :c:`true`. Arguments are converted to :c:`bool`\s (so,
    non-zero integer is :c:`1`, otherwise it's :c:`0`), then they are compared.

.. _lbl-libcc-ccdefines-coordinatesizeconstants:

Coordinate, size constants
--------------------------

Invalid, off-board coordinate.

No valid trance-journey starting from any chessboard field could get to this coordinate,
and still make it back to any on-board field.

Used for e.g. missing coordinates.

.. code-block:: C
    :force:

    #define CC_INVALID_COORD (INT_MIN + 3583) // + number, so that value can't be get by accident, e.g. by simply flipping bits, ...

The smallest and the largest valid on-board coordinate, and board sizes.

The largest valid coordinate, board size is for the largest board, used by One
variant. For other variants actual upper limit is smaller.

.. TODO
    .. sealso::
        , see `cc_variant_board_size()`.

.. code-block:: C
    :force:

    #define CC_MIN_BOARD_COORD (0)
    #define CC_MAX_BOARD_COORD (25)

    #define CC_MIN_BOARD_SIZE (8)
    #define CC_MAX_BOARD_SIZE (26)

Light and dark field check constant. Used when checking if colors of a piece and
field are the same, or different.

.. code-block:: C
    :force:

    #define CC_FIELD_COLOR_LIGHT (1)
    #define CC_FIELD_COLOR_DARK (0)
