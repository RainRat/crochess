    Frees everything from all of given chessboard, moves, plies, steps.

    Function is meant as a convenience, to allow for one-liner to free
    allocated resources (even in the middle of building whole move data
    structure), before returning from a calling test function.

    @param gm__f A game, can be `NULL`.
    @param cb__f A chessboard, can be `NULL`.
    @param moves__f Linked list of moves, can be `NULL`.
    @param plies__f Linked list of plies, can be `NULL`.
    @param steps__f Linked list of steps, can be `NULL`.
    @param cumulative_result A cumulative result so far.

    @note
    Any of ponters can be `NULL`, in which case they are skipped,
    and don't affect result returned.

    Argument `cumulative_result` is meant for functions returning
    `bool` result, so tests could be writen as:
    @code{.c}
    bool result = true; // cumulative result of tests

    // Assuming test_1 returns bool too.
    // Putting it to first place is mandatory,
    // to ensure it's actually run, even if result is already `false`.
    result = test_1( ... ) && result;

    result = test_2( ... ) && result; // Ditto for test 2.

    return cc_game_move_data_free_all( NULL, &cb__o, &move__o, NULL, NULL, result ); // return cumulative result
    @endcode

    Failure can be enforced (e.g. when allocation fails),
    simply by passing `false` as an argument, e.g.:
    @code{.c}
    if ( !cc_ply_cascade_append_new( ... ) )
        return cc_game_move_data_free_all( NULL, &cb__o, NULL, &plies_0, &steps_2, false ); // false == enforced failure
    @endcode

    @return `true` if cumulatively successful, `false` otherwise.
