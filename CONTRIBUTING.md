Best way to contribute to project is to [donate](https://github.com/sponsors/mmlacak), if you can.
All donations are appreciated. Thank you!

Second best way is to become an advocate; spread the word, both on all social media you use, and in personal contacts.

Distant third is to contribute source code patches.
I require all contributed code to have copyright (and all other legal rights) explicitly assigned to me, prior to inclusion into the project's codebase.

Failing to provide explicit rights assignment before making any contribution to the project, contributor(s) are assumed to have read this document, agree with its terms, conditions and are implicitly assigning copyright (and all other legal rights) to me, and waive any legal claims or actions against me, or the project.

Thank you all for your contributions!
