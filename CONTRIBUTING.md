Best way to contribute to project is to [donate](https://github.com/sponsors/mmlacak), if you can.
All donations are appreciated. Thank you!

Second best way is to become an advocate; spread the word, both on all social media you use, and in personal contacts.

Distant third is to contribute source text and code patches.
I require all contributed text and code to have copyright (and related legal rights) explicitly assigned to me, prior to inclusion into the project's codebase.

By making any contribution to the project, contributor(s) acknowledge to have read this document, agree with its terms and conditions, and have assigned copyright (and related legal rights) of their contribution(s) to me.

Please, check [How to contribute](https://github.com/mmlacak/crochess/blob/master/docs/source/howto.rst#contribute) documentation, before doing so.

Thank you all for your contributions!
