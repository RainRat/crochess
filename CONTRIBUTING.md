Best way to contribute to project is to donate.

Second best way is to become an advocate; spread the word, both on all social media you use, and in personal contacts.

Distant third is to contribute source code patches.
I require all contributed code to have copyright (and all other legal rights) explicitly assigned to me, prior to inclusion into the project's codebase.

Thank you all for your contributions!
